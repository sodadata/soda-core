# TODOs

* [ ] Finish threshold testing  in [soda_core/tests/components/test_thresholds.py](soda-core/tests/soda_core/tests/components/test_thresholds.py)
* [ ] Finish missing regex implementation and docs
* [ ] Test & document identity & qualifiers
* [ ] Define and test naming restrictions. What are the data source naming restrictions?  Same for the qualifiers.  All to ensure we can generate consistent check identities.
* [ ] Create a release procedure in [README.md](README.md#creating-a-new-release)
* [ ] Test & document doc links
* [ ] Consider adding index checking to the schema check.
* [ ] Figure out what `os.getenv("TEST_TABLE_SEED", None)` does in TestTable.__test_table_hash
