# Integrate with Slack

Integrate your Slack workspace in your [Soda Cloud]({% link documentation/glossary.md %}#soda-cloud) account so that Soda Cloud can send Slack notifications to your team when a data issue triggers an [alert]({% link documentation/glossary.md %}#alert).

1. In Soda Cloud, navigate to **Profile** > **Integrations**, then follow the guided steps to authorize Soda Cloud to connect to your Slack workspace. 
2. Select the all Slack channels to which you might send notifications when Soda finds an issue with your data, then **Save**.

* [Create an alert]({% link documentation/monitors.md %}) to send Slack notifications when a scan surfaces a data issue.
* [Connect]({% link documentation/connect_to_cloud.md %}) Soda SQL to your Soda Cloud account.
